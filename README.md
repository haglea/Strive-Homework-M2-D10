Goal

Create a gog.com clone.

    Use Bootstrap's grid system and any CSS trick you've learned in this module.
    Avoid wasting too much time on that carousel and don't even bother trying to customize the one shipped with Bootstrap. If you really care, go and grab other carousels around the web as soon as you're finished with everything else (but since you will very likely run out of time, leave it alone!)
    No 1-on-1s allowed. Google Is Your Friend.
    "Delivered with some issues" is better than "pixel-perfect but unfinished"

Good luck!
